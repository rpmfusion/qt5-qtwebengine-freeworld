Quoting the description from qtwebengine-6.7.0-ninja1.12.patch:
"""
Patch status: pending being looked at upstream

Issue[1][2][3] also exist in chromium itself[4], and unclear
why this started happening only with ninja-1.12.0 at the moment.

Just a quickfix, likely not fully correct and seems there may
be further unresolved race issues.
